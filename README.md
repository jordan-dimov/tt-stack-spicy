turner-townsend Coding Test - Jordan Dimov
==========================================

This is my solution to the Stack - Spicy coding test, implementing a stack-based Fifth interpreter.

To set up, make a new virtualenv and install requirements:

    mkvirtualenv -p python3.7 tt-stack-spicy
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -e .


To lint the code and run the unit tests, run `make test`

To run the CLI type `python fifth.py`. Use the interpreter as per the language specification. Type `QUIT` to exit.
